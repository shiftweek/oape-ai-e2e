# OAPE AI E2E Feature Development

This document provides context for AI agents when working with the OAPE AI E2E Feature Development tools.

## Purpose

This project provides AI-driven tools for end-to-end feature development in OpenShift operators. The workflow takes an Enhancement Proposal (EP) and generates:
1. API type definitions (Go structs)
2. Integration tests for the API types
3. Controller/reconciler implementation code

## Commands

| Command                                   | Purpose                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/oape:init <repo-short-name>`            | Clone an allowed operator repo by short name                   |
| `/oape:api-generate <EP-URL>`             | Generate Go API types from Enhancement Proposal                |
| `/oape:api-generate-tests <path>`         | Generate integration test suites for API types                 |
| `/oape:api-implement <EP-URL>`            | Generate controller code from Enhancement Proposal + API types |
| `/oape:e2e-generate <base-branch>`        | Generate e2e test artifacts from git diff against base branch  |
| `/oape:review <ticket_id> [base_ref]`     | Production-grade code review against Jira requirements         |
| `/oape:implement-review-fixes <report>`   | Automatically apply fixes from a review report                 |

## Typical Workflow

```bash
# 1. Clone an operator repository (if not already cloned)
/oape:init cert-manager-operator

# 2. Generate API types
/oape:api-generate https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/XXXX

# 3. Generate integration tests for the API types
/oape:api-generate-tests api/v1alpha1/

# 4. Generate controller implementation
/oape:api-implement https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/pull/XXXX

# 5. Build and verify
make generate && make manifests && make build && make test

# 6. Generate e2e tests for your changes
/oape:e2e-generate main
```

## Supported Operator Repositories

The allowed repositories and their base branches are defined in [`team-repos.csv`](team-repos.csv). DO NOT raise PRs on any repos beyond that list. Always read `team-repos.csv` to determine the correct repo URL and base branch before cloning or creating branches.

---

## Operator Framework Detection

The commands automatically detect which framework the repository uses:

| Framework              | Detection                                   | Code Pattern                          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **controller-runtime** | `sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime` in go.mod  | `Reconcile(ctx, req) (Result, error)` |
| **library-go**         | `github.com/openshift/library-go` in go.mod | `sync(ctx, syncCtx) error`            |

## Prerequisites

Before running commands, ensure:

- **gh** (GitHub CLI) - installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)
- **go** - Go toolchain installed
- **git** - Git installed
- **make** - Make installed

---

## Key Conventions

When generating code, these conventions are followed:

1. **OpenShift API Conventions** - [dev-guide/api-conventions.md](https://github.com/openshift/enhancements/blob/master/dev-guide/api-conventions.md)
2. **Kubernetes API Conventions** - [sig-architecture/api-conventions.md](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md)
3. **Effective Go** - [go.dev/doc/effective_go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go)
4. **Kubebuilder Patterns** - [book.kubebuilder.io](https://book.kubebuilder.io/)

---

## Important Notes

- Always run `/oape:api-generate` before `/oape:api-generate-tests` or `/oape:api-implement`
- The commands READ existing code patterns and replicate them
- Generated code follows the repository's existing style
- API types are NOT modified by `api-generate-tests` or `api-implement` (they only read them)
