Add a new Custom Resource and controller for the Foo resource.

Requirements:
- New CRD with spec fields: name, replicas, image.
- Controller reconciles Foo and creates a Deployment and Service.
- Follow controller-runtime and OpenShift API conventions.
- Include validation (e.g. replicas > 0), finalizer for cleanup.
