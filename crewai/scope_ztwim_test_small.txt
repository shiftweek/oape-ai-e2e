Small test change for OAPE workflow: add a single constant and unit test only.

Scope (minimal, for testing the pipeline):
- Add one exported constant in the ZTWIM codebase, e.g. in pkg/ or a small types file: TestFeatureFlag or OAPETestConstant = "oape-test-v1".
- Add one unit test that asserts the constant has the expected value.
- No CRD changes, no reconciliation logic, no new APIs. This is only to verify the OAPE workflow (design → review → tests first → implementation → compile → apply to repo) runs end-to-end in the ZTWIM repo.
- Prefer an existing package under the repo layout; do not create many new files.
