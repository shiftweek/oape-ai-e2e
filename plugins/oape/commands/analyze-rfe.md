description: Analyze an RFE and output meaningful EPIC, user stories, and their outcomes
argument-hint: <rfe-key>

## Name
oape:analyze-rfe

## Synopsis
```
/oape:analyze-rfe <rfe-key>
```

## Description

The `oape:analyze-rfe` command analyzes a Request for Enhancement (RFE) from Jira and generates a comprehensive breakdown of Epics, user stories, and their outcomes with technical feasibility assessment. This helps product and engineering teams transform RFEs into actionable, well-estimated implementation plans.

This command is particularly useful for:
- Breaking down complex RFEs into implementable work items
- Planning sprints and releases from RFE requests with effort estimates
- Identifying technical risks, dependencies, and blockers early
- Creating epics and stories that align with RFE scope
- Understanding the full scope and outcomes of an RFE before implementation
- Preparing for refinement or planning sessions with comprehensive analysis
- Discovering related work to prevent duplication and enable reuse

The command performs deep analysis of:
- The RFE's nature and description
- Current limitations and desired behavior
- Business requirements and use cases
- Affected packages and components
- **Technical complexity and risks**: Assesses implementation difficulty, identifies blockers
- **Cross-component dependencies**: Maps integration points and team handoffs
- **Effort estimation**: Provides t-shirt sizing (XS/S/M/L/XL) for sprint planning
- **Related work discovery**: Searches Jira for related RFEs, epics, bugs to prevent duplication
- **Workspace context** (optional): When the workspace contains `context.md` files (e.g., `docs/component-context/context.md`), the command loads component Purpose, Scope, and Key Areas to enrich the breakdown
- **Comprehensive component context**: Deep repository analysis including:
  - Repository discovery (downstream/upstream/related repos)
  - Codebase structure analysis (architecture patterns, key packages, API types)
  - Implementation logic understanding (reconciliation flows, integration patterns)
  - Historical context (relevant PRs, design discussions, ADRs, lessons learned)
  - Synthesized insights (design principles, risk factors, recommended approach)

## Implementation

This command invokes the `analyze-rfe` skill to:

1. **Fetch RFE** - Retrieve the RFE from Jira via REST API (e.g. `fetch_rfe.py`)
2. **Parse Structure** - Extract nature, description, business requirements, affected components
3. **Discover Related Work** - Search Jira for related RFEs, epics, bugs; identify reuse opportunities
4. **Gather Workspace Context** - Search for `context.md` files in the workspace (e.g., `docs/component-context/context.md`). When components match the RFE, load Purpose, Scope, Key Areas, and use them to enrich epics and stories
5. **Comprehensive Component Context** - For affected components (via `gather_component_context.py` or equivalent):
   - Discover repositories (downstream, upstream, related)
   - Analyze codebase structure (architecture, packages, API types)
   - Understand implementation logic (patterns, integration points)
   - Gather historical context (PRs, design discussions, ADRs, lessons learned)
   - Synthesize insights (design principles, recommended approach, risks)
6. **Generate EPIC(s)** - Break down the RFE into one or more epics with scope and acceptance criteria
7. **Assess Technical Complexity** - Analyze complexity, identify risks, blockers, and tech debt impact
8. **Map Dependencies** - Identify epic dependencies, integration points, and cross-team handoffs
9. **Generate User Stories** - Create user stories for each epic in proper "As a... I want... So that..." format
10. **Estimate Effort** - Provide t-shirt sizing (XS=1 sprint, S=2 sprints, M=3 sprints, L=4 sprints, XL=5 sprints; 1 sprint = 3 weeks) and map story dependencies (calibrated using historical PR analysis when available)
11. **Define Outcomes** - Specify the measurable outcomes and value each story delivers
12. **Generate Implementation Summary** - Aggregate effort, dependencies, and risks across all epics

For detailed implementation, see:

## Arguments

- **$1 – rfe-key** *(required)*
  Jira issue key for the RFE (e.g., `RFE-1234`).
  Can also accept a full Jira URL; the key will be extracted automatically.

## Return Value

- **Comprehensive Markdown Report** including:
  - RFE Summary
  - Related Work (Jira search results)
  - Component Context (from workspace, if available)
  - Comprehensive Component Context (repository analysis, when performed)
  - EPIC(s) with objective, scope, acceptance criteria, complexity, risks, dependencies
  - User stories with acceptance criteria, effort estimates, dependencies
  - Implementation summary with effort overview and risk aggregation
  - Outcomes mapping (what each story delivers)
- **Optional**: Output can be saved to `.work/jira/analyze-rfe/<rfe-key>/breakdown.md`

## Next Steps
1. Review with product/engineering teams
2. Use your Jira workflow to create epics and stories from this breakdown
3. Schedule spikes for unknowns
```

## Examples

### Basic Usage

Analyze an RFE and generate the breakdown:
```
/oape:analyze-rfe RFE-1234
```

### With URL

The command accepts Jira URLs:
```
/oape:analyze-rfe https://issues.redhat.com/browse/RFE-1234
```

## Error Handling

- **Issue Not Found**: Verify RFE key and Jira permissions
- **Not an RFE**: If the issue is not from the RFE project or not a Feature Request type, warn the user but proceed with analysis
- **Sparse RFE**: If the RFE lacks sufficient detail, indicate gaps and suggest what information would improve the breakdown

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, you must complete the following setup:

### Required Setup

1. **Jira Personal Access Token**
   - Visit: https://issues.redhat.com/secure/ViewProfile.jspa?selectedTab=com.atlassian.pats.pats-plugin:jira-user-personal-access-tokens
   - Click "Create token"
   - Give it a name (e.g., "Claude Code - analyze-rfe")
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again)

2. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   export JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN="your_token_here"
   export JIRA_URL="https://issues.redhat.com"  # Optional, defaults to this
   ```

3. **Verify Setup**
   Test your token works:
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JIRA_PERSONAL_TOKEN" \
        "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/myself"
   ```
   You should see your user profile JSON.

4. **Install Python Dependencies**
